To run the code first run the untitiled(1).ipynb in colab and and train the model and then download the model as Retinanet_model as a zip and unzip it in the project directory directory,
you can also run it in colab if you don't have gpu in your laptop, but with a little modification in main.py file You can refet this link https://medium.com/@kshitijvijay271199/flask-on-google-colab-f6525986797b
